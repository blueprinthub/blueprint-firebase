/**
 * The representation of a project in Blueprint. This project is
 * linked to platform specified in the {@link PlatformName} enum. The
 * {@link Project} entity is used to represent a project in the Blueprint
 * database, mirroring the project in from the platform.
 * Since Blueprint is a multi-platform application, the {@link Project} entity
 * is used as a common language between the different platforms integrations.
 * Some fields are optional, since not all platforms provide the same
 * information.
 * @interface
 * @property {string} id - Kick-off identifier for the project.
 * @property {string} platformId - Platform-specific identifier for the project.
 * @property {URL} platformURL - Platform-specific URL for the project
 * (ex: Jira URL).
 * @property {PlatformName} platformName - The integration way of the project.
 * @property {string} name - The name of the project.
 * @property {string} description - A brief description of the project.
 * @property {URL} URL - URL of the project icon, if available.
 * @property {string} colorHex - The color of the project.
 * @property {string} owner - The owner of the project.
 * @property {string} slug - Slug of the project for indexed search.
 * @example
 * {
  id: "1234567890",
